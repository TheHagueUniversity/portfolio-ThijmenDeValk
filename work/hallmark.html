                    <p>A bespoke concept, tailored to just two users, for a new digital Hallmark unwrapping experience.</p>
                    <p>The concept was made as part of a group assignement for my study, User Experience Design. In groups of two, we worked on both the giving and receiving end of the experience.</p>

                <div class="section__item">
                    <p>In this concept, the giver wants to remenis about a shared holiday. She creates a treasure hunt, packed with memories. The receiver gets a card with a map and scans it with this special app. Now, the treasure hunt pops up.</p>
                    <p>At every location, a question is asked that fits both the location and their shared interests. Once all questions are answered, the digital gifts is unlocked and revealed to the receiver.</p>
